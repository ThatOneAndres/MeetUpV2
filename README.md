# MeetUp

An application to meetup with friends at a closest common location. The application takes the location of four users and finds the midpoint between them. Based on that midpoint location, meetup points will be recommended. Each user can select a type of place they would like to meet at (bar, resturant, local attraction ect.). Google maps will be used to show each user's location and Yelp will be used to find places to meet based on the midpoint location. At this time this application will only accept queries and locations from four users at any given time. Support for additional users may be added at a later time.
